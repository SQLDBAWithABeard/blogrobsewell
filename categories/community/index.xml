&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted a few things on LinkedIn recently about job titles. The discussion was lively — as it always is — and the general vibe was something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;titles don&amp;rsquo;t define what you do, they&amp;rsquo;re just the label on the drawer.&amp;rdquo; A drawer full of skills, experiences, weird technical rabbit holes at midnight, blog posts, conference talks, and approximately one thousand cups of tea remains the same drawer regardless of what&amp;rsquo;s written on the front.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Be a Mentor?</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/why-be-a-mentor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/why-be-a-mentor/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2025/mentor.png" alt="Featured image of post Why Be a Mentor?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://debthedba.wordpress.com/2025/03/04/t-sql-tuesday-184-the-invitation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This post will describe how the automation was created using a GitHub Issue and two GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-need"&gt;What do we need?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to have a form for user input that could easily allow a person to add themselves and some information to a web page. The page holds a list of speakers who can present training day sessions for data platform events. &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;The web page can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;So we built a thing for speakers to add themselves and for events to find them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think event organisers know who the &lt;em&gt;big names&lt;/em&gt; are and the topics that they can deliver for full day training sessions or pre-cons as they are also known. Finding other speakers and finding speakers who can deliver on different topics is a little more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/containers2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="broken-link"&gt;Broken Link

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new process to create a Data Saturdays Event page, so I thought I would write an explanation and a run through&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-data-saturdays-"&gt;What is Data Saturdays ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, not everyone will know what a Data Saturday event is, so lets start with that. There are two parts to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Data Saturday is an event that provides (usually free) training and information sessions about Azure Data and SQL Server. At present they are hosted online.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Values The Community</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/microsoft-values-the-community/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/microsoft-values-the-community/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2021/MSCommunity.png" alt="Featured image of post Microsoft Values The Community" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="what-happens-next"&gt;What Happens Next?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When PASS announced that operations would cease, a common question was &amp;ldquo;OK, so what happens now? To SQL Saturdays?, to the summit?, to the local user groups?&amp;rdquo; The answers to some of those questions will lie in other conversations but for right now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Local User Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="user-groups"&gt;User Groups
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;User groups are a fantastic way to expand your knowledge and your network. A place to find like minded people performing similar roles that you can learn from and get support from.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#TSQL2sDay – NomNomNomNomNom</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/tsql2sday-nomnomnomnomnom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/tsql2sday-nomnomnomnomnom/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/03/pille-riin-priske-1238490-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post #TSQL2sDay – NomNomNomNomNom" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://nocolumnname.blog/2019/03/05/t-sql-tuesday-112-dipping-into-your-cookie-jar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;I have returned home from SQLBits 2017 The Disco Edition. I am exhausted, my body is pointing out to me in a variety of ways that this is the only week of the year that I spend so much time on my feet. Why would anyone do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="many-months-of-work"&gt;Many months of work
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First though, you need to know that the SQLBits conference is organised and run by volunteers. All of the committee spend many, many long hours, out of their own free time, for many months before and after the event to ensure that the attendees, sponsors, speakers and volunteers experience is trouble free. I think that they do an amazing and fantastic job and repeatedly pull off the best, most enjoyable conference that I have been to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>2016 - That was a Year :-)</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/2016-that-was-a-year-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/2016-that-was-a-year-/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Its the time of year for reflection and I have had the most amazing 2016, I am blessed that I love what I do so much.

&lt;p&gt;So SQLBits has finished for another year. About 1500 people registered for the largest SQL Conference in Europe held over 4 days in Liverpool last week. 2 days of full day sessions and 2 days of shorter sessions, a pub quiz, a party (literally) out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is organised and run by volunteers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we must pay special thanks to Simon, Darren, Chris, Jonathan, Annette, Allan and Alex without forgetting all that JRJ has done. They ensured that the venue, sessions, speakers, sponsors, audio visual and not forgetting the amazing party by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sneaky Experience (Thank you Julia),&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; all occurred at the right time in the right place with the right people and the work and effort they have put in cannot be over-estimated but this post isn’t about those generous, inspiring, amazing folk
Several people asked me what a volunteer does and how they can become one and hopefully this post will answer both of those questions. More than 40 people volunteered to help at SQL Bits&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Strategies - A #TSQL2sDay post</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/enterprise-strategies-a-tsql2sday-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/enterprise-strategies-a-tsql2sday-post/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2015/09/time-for-t-sql-tuesday-70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;description&amp;gt;SQL Server has come a long way in the last few years, with Microsoft investing heavily in High Availability features. This session will show you how to use these features to enable you to safely upgrade a SQL Server, while ensuring you have a return path if things should go wrong. You will leave the session knowing what features you can use to upgrade either the OS, Hardware or SQL Server version while keeping your maintenance window to a minimum. The session will apply to Standard Edition as well as Enterprise Edition, so doesn&amp;#39;t only apply to &amp;#39;High Rollers&amp;#39;!&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&amp;lt;/event&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be giving my Making PowerShell Useful for your Team presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have heard about PowerShell and may be spent a little bit of time exploring some of the ways in which it will benefit you at work. You want to be able to perform tasks more specific to your organisation and need to share them with your team. I will show you how you can achieve this by demonstrating&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Giving Back – #TSQL2sday</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/giving-back-tsql2sday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/giving-back-tsql2sday/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TSQL2sDay150x150.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;T-SQL Tuesday, which was started by Adam Machanic (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a class="link" href="http://twitter.com/adammachanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) and is now starting its 6th year, is hosted by a different person each month. The host selects the theme, and then the blogging begins. Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme. This month it is hosted by Wayne Sheffield &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2014/12/t-sql-tuesday-61-giving-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and in the spirit of the holiday season it is about giving. This is my post on giving back, in the little ways as well as the bigger ones, how you can give back and why it not only benefits others but also yourself&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SQL Saturday Exeter&amp;ndash;What&amp;rsquo;s the Point?

&lt;p&gt;In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
