I really enjoy giving presentations and when I saw Start-Demo being used at the PowerShell Conference in Hanover I started to make use of it in my presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Start-Demo&lt;/code&gt; was written in 2007 by a fella who knows PowerShell pretty well ðŸ™‚Â  &lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2007/03/03/start-demo-help-doing-demos-using-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;It was then updated in 2012 by Max Trinidad &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.maxtblog.com/2012/02/powershell-start-demo-now-allows-multi-lines-onliners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;This enabled support for multi-line code using backticks at the end of each line. This works well but I dislike having to use the backticks in foreach loops, it confuses people who think that they need to be included and to my mind looks a bit messy&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
