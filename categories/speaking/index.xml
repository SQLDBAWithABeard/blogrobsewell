&lt;h1 id="who-was-your-mentor"&gt;Who was your mentor?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never had an official mentor but I am so very very grateful to all of the people who have helped, supported and inspired me throughout my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel so privileged to be able to reach out to so many wonderful people and ask questions and receive advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
