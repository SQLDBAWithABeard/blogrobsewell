I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;written about SQLBits&lt;/a&gt;, it is close to my heart and has had a significant impact on my life, my career and my circle of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was around May of 2013 that I had written a blog post about spinning up and shutting down an Azure lab with PowerShell after being inspired at my first &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;SQLBits Conference&lt;/a&gt; (On a side note, I have attended, volunteered or spoken at every one since and this year I was delighted to become a Committee Member - If you have comments/questions/advice please feel free to email me at rob at sqlbits.com).

&gt;how to write your first Pester test&lt;/a&gt; to validate something. Hereâ€™s a recap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide the information you wish to test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand how to get it with PowerShell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what makes it pass and what makes it fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a Pester Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably have more than one instance that you want to test, so how do you loop through a collection of instances? There are a couple of ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Volunteer at SQLBits ?</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/why-volunteer-at-sqlbits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/why-volunteer-at-sqlbits/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING â€“ Contains Orange and light-hearted photos ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have returned home from SQLBits 2017 The Disco Edition. I am exhausted, my body is pointing out to me in a variety of waysÂ that this is the only week of the year that I spend so much time on my feet. Why would anyone do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="many-months-of-work"&gt;Many months of work
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First though, you need to know that the SQLBits conference is organised and run by volunteers. All of the committee spend many, many long hours, out of their own free time, for many months before and after the event to ensure that the attendees, sponsors, speakers and volunteers experience is trouble free. I think that they do an amazing and fantastic job and repeatedly pull off the best, most enjoyable conference that I have been to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Day In The Life of a SQLBits Volunteer</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-sqlbits-volunteer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-sqlbits-volunteer/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/dscn0286-3.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A Day In The Life of a SQLBits Volunteer" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/05/dscn0286-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;So SQLBits has finished for another year. About 1500 people registered for the largest SQL Conference in Europe held over 4 days in Liverpool last week. 2 days of full day sessions and 2 days of shorter sessions, a pub quiz, a party (literally) out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is organised and run by volunteers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, youâ€™re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we must pay special thanks to Simon, Darren, Chris, Jonathan, Annette, Allan and Alex without forgetting all that JRJ has done. They ensured that the venue, sessions, speakers, sponsors, audio visual and not forgetting the amazing party by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sneaky Experience (Thank you Julia),&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; all occurred at the right time in the right place with the right people and the work and effort they have put in cannot be over-estimated but this post isnâ€™t about those generous, inspiring, amazing folk
Several people asked me what a volunteer does and how they can become one and hopefully this post will answer both of those questions. More than 40 people volunteered to help at SQL Bits&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Giving Back â€“ #TSQL2sday</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/giving-back-tsql2sday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/giving-back-tsql2sday/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TSQL2sDay150x150.jpg"

Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme.

&lt;p&gt;In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa Oâ€™Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events. Â I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I havenâ€™t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>12 Things I learnt at SQLBits XI</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/12-things-i-learnt-at-sqlbits-xi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/12-things-i-learnt-at-sqlbits-xi/</guid><description>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a scheduled Powershell job which I use to create an Excel file colour coded for backup checks. (I will blog about it another time) It works brilliantly on my desktop and saves the file to a UNC path and emails the team the location. It works brilliantly when run in Powershell on the server. When I schedule it to run though it doesnâ€™t do so well. The job completes without errors but no file is saved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
