Another post in the [PowerShell Box of Tricks](https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#box-of-tricks) series. Here is another script which I use to save me time and effort during my daily workload enabling me to spend more time on more important (to me) things!

Todays question which I often get asked is What databases are on that server?

This is often a follow up to a question that requires the [Find-Database script](https://blog.robsewell.com/using-powershell-to-find-a-database-amongst-hundreds/). It is often asked by support teams investigating issues. It can also be asked by developers checking the impact of other services on their DEV/UAT environments, by change managers investigating impact of changes, by service managers investigating the impact of downtime, when capacity planning for a new service and numerous other situations.

A simple quick and easy question made simpler with this function which can also be called when creating documentation

<P>Simply call it with 

    Show-DatabasesOnServer SERVERNAME 
    
and use the results as you need</P>

This only shows you the name but if you need more information about your databases then have a look and see what you require.

Use \`Get-Member\` to see what is there. I ran the following code to count the number of Properties available for Databases (Using PowerShell V3 on SQL Server 2012 SP1 11.0.3350.0 )

154 Properties that you can examine and that is just for databases:-)

Picking out a few properties you could do something like this

If you want aliases for your column headings you will need to add a bit of code to the select.

For Example, maybe you want to Database Name as a heading and the Size in Gb (Its in Mb in the example above) You would need to create a hash table with a Label element and an Expression element. The Label is the column heading and the Expression can just be the data or a calculation on data.

So select Name becomes

    select @{label="Database Name";Expression={$_.Name}}

<P>The Column Heading is Database Name and the data is the Name property</P>
<P>and select Size becomes</P>

    Select @{label="Size GB";Expression={"{0:N3}" -f ($_.Size/1024)}}

<P>The Column Heading is Size GB and the data is the Size property divided by 1024 to 3 decimal places</P>
<P>then your code would look like this</P>

    $srv.databases|select @{label="Server";Expression={$_.Parent.name}},` 
    @{label="Database Name";Expression={$_.Name}}, Owner, Collation, CompatibilityLevel,` 
    RecoveryModel, @{label="Size GB";Expression={"{0:N3}" -f ($_.Size/1024)}}|` 
    Format-Table -Wrap â€“AutoSize

and the results

        Returns the databases on a SQL Server and their size
        .DESCRIPTION
        Returns Database Name and Size in MB for databases on a SQL server
        .EXAMPLE
        Show-DatabasesOnServer
    
        This will return the user database names and sizes on the local machine     default instance
        .EXAMPLE
        Show-DatabasesOnServer -Servers SERVER1
    
        This will return the database names and sizes on SERVER1
        .EXAMPLE
        Show-DatabasesOnServer -Servers SERVER1 -IncludeSystemDatabases
    
        This will return all of the database names and sizes on SERVER1     including system databases
        .EXAMPLE
        Show-DatabasesOnServer -Servers 'SERVER1','SERVER2\INSTANCE'
    
        This will return the user database names and sizes on SERVER1 and     SERVER2\INSTANCE
        .EXAMPLE
        $Servers = 'SERVER1','SERVER2','SERVER3'
        Show-DatabasesOnServer -Servers $servers|out-file c:\temp\dbsize.txt
    
        This will get the user database names and sizes on SERVER1, SERVER2 and     SERVER3 and export to a text file c:\temp\dbsize.txt
