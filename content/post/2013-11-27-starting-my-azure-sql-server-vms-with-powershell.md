The last post about [Launching Azure VMs with PowerShell](https://blog.robsewell.com/?p=505) made someone ask me to explain how I start my Azure VMs normally so here goes.

When I decide to write a blog post or develop and test a script or run through demos from a presentation or blog post I fire up my Azure Virtual machines with PowerShell. This is how I do it

Open PowerShell and check that I am connected to my default subscription by running `Get-AzureSubscription`

Note â€“ You must have installed Windows Azure PowerShell and installed the PublishSettingsFile or used `Add-AzureAccount` for your subscription following the steps here

[http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/install-and-configure-windows-powershell/](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/install-and-configure-windows-powershell/)

Then I run the following three Cmdlets

`Get-AzureVM` shows me the VMs associated with that subscription.

I then pipe to `Start-AzureVM` as I want to start both machines. If I only wanted one I would check that

    Get-AzureVM -name Fade2Black -ServiceName TheBestBeard

returned the correct machine and then pipe that to `Start-AzureVM`

Once the VMs have started I use `Get-AzureRemoteDesktopFile` giving a local path for the rdp file and specifying `â€“Launch` to run the RDP session

and away we go ðŸ™‚

Once I have finished simply run

and my machines are stopped and no longer running my credit down.
