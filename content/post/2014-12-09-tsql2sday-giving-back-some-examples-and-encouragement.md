<P>T-SQL Tuesday, which was started by Adam Machanic (<A href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/">blog</A>|<A href="http://twitter.com/adammachanic">twitter</A>) and is now starting its 6<SUP>th</SUP> year, is hosted by a different person each month. The host selects the theme, and then the blogging begins. Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme. This month it is hosted by Wayne Sheffield <A href="http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2014/12/t-sql-tuesday-61-giving-back/" target=_blank>blog</A>|<A href="http://www.twitter.com/#/DBAWayne" target=_blank>twitter</A> and in the spirit of the holiday season it is about giving. This is my post on giving back, in the little ways as well as the bigger ones, how you can give back and why it not only benefits others but also yourself</P>
<H3>What’s the SQL Family?</H3>
<P>The SQL Family (or SQL community call it what you will) is a fabulous place to be. Full of many wonderful, talented, passionate and generous people. Every method of interaction that you wish for can be found if you look. Ever wanted to know how others do it? or Does this happen in other shops? or I wish I had access to someone who knows about ‘insert new shiny thing here’?</P>
<P>I guess that that is how I joined. I had no peers in my shop. I had no one to turn to to ask questions or get advice. I had no support and I turned to the internet. Now we all know that the internet lies. It is full of accidental and deliberate mistruths, of part information and downright bad advice. You have to be careful where you go and who you trust. I gradually found myself going back to the same resources and from those I found out about PASS and user groups</P>
<P>I am in the UK. I found the list of UK SQL User Groups</P>
<DIV class=googlemaps><IFRAME height=480 marginHeight=0 src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zmQEePRxQSZg.kqsvgFUAQc3w" frameBorder=0 width=640 marginWidth=0 scrolling=no></IFRAME></DIV>
<P>You can find more <A href="http://www.sqlpass.org/passchapters.aspx" target=_blank>here</A> both local and virtual</P>
<H3>User Groups</H3>
<P>I found a <A href="http://sqlsouthwest.co.uk" target=_blank>user group near me</A> and went along to a meeting not knowing what to expect. I found a group of people like me willing to give up their time to learn and share knowledge. A wide range of people from DBAs, Developers, BI Professionals and SysAdmins. Working for International multi regional companies looking after many hundreds of SQL Servers to single sysadmins looking after the whole kit and caboodle and everything in between. A wealth and breadth of knowledge to tap into. You will learn so much not only from the sessions but also the conversation with all these other talented people</P>
<P>Come along.</P>
<P>Simply coming along will bring benefit. Other people will be interested in what you have to say even if you are in week 0 of your first ever job. Your view will still be valued. Everyone can learn from everybody and NO-ONE knows it all.</P>
<P>There will come a point where you will pass on a piece of knowledge or an idea or a way of working and someone will say thank you I didn’t know that. You just gave back. It may even be someone you look up to, someone whose knowledge and experience far outweighs yours whose word you hang on to. That feels good.</P>
<P>You may ask the questions that others thought but didnt ask and boy are they glad you asked the question. You just gave back. It’s something I do often. I ask questions and sometimes I ask questions I know the answer to so that they will be of benefit to the group.</P>
<P>What will you get? More than you can ever put in. Free training, often free pizza, knowledge, advice,guidance, contacts, support, a network of people in your field, notice of job openings, swag, fun, friends, more social events and more and more</P>
<P>The user groups are run by volunteers in their own time out of the goodness of their hearts. They will always need your help. Turn up 5 minutes earlier and help set out the chairs or put out the handouts or assist with the tech. You just gave back. Afterwards before going to the pub clear the tables, help carry the boxes, put the pizza evidence in the bin. You just gave back</P>
<H3>SQL Saturdays and other community events</H3>
<P>SQL Saturdays are held all over the world most every Saturday You can find more about them here <A href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/" target=_blank>https://www.sqlsaturday.com/</A> There are also other larger events such as <A href="http://sqlbits.com" target=_blank>SQL Bits</A> and <A href="http://sqlrelay.co.uk" target=_blank>SQL Relay</A> here in the UK. Everything I wrote about User groups counts here just in a slightly larger scale. You will be able to attend several sessions across many different areas for free on a Saturday</P>
<P>These events are also run by volunteers and they will also need your help. If you can spare some time to help on a registration desk you just gave back. A room monitor to ensure the speaker and delegates have everything they need, the room is tidy and the session runs to time. You just gave back. Putting things out and tidying them away again. You just gave back.</P>
<P>You can become a volunteer by asking the people organising the events if they would like your help. These events will all have twitter feeds and emails and facebook pages and many methods of getting in touch. Contact them and offer your help if you can. You just gave back.</P>
<P>If you fancy taking the next step then you can get involved in organising the events. This is hard work, great fun, a good thing to add to your CV and you just gave back. There are so many areas to get involved organising an event. Premises and technology, speakers and printers, volunteers and sponsors all need co-ordination. Websites,twitter feeds, feedback forms, posters, marketing materials all need designing and producing. There are so many ways in which you will be able to provide value to the event and you just gave back</P>
<P>Oh and whilst I am at it, when you attend an event</P>
<P>Say Thank You to the volunteers. You just gave back.</P>
<H3>Speaking and Blogging</H3>
<P>All the events named above need speakers. The bigger events like the SQL Saturdays and the large events like SQL Bits will generally have more established speakers but every user group will need speakers and they will be more likely to accept new speakers and will be very supportive if you say that you are a new speaker. Every speaker had to make their first presentation at some point and they all know how it feels and can provide guidance and advice. You will feel that you don’t have anything to speak about that others will want to hear about. You do. Your experience and your knowledge or how you solved something or created something will be of interest to people. Of course, you need to check with the user group leaders and members if your idea for a presentation is suitable. Like anything you do that is new, researching it and taking advice from people with more experience is always useful. Maybe you can start with a lightning talk. Give it a go. You just gave back.</P>
<P>What do you get back from Speaking and Blogging?</P>
<P>I’ll tell you a secret. The vast majority of my posts ( This is an exception) are written for the benefit of one person. Me.</P>
<P>I write posts to record my learning for myself. To document my knowledge. I use my posts to help me to do my job. I know that I wrote the method of doing something somewhere and this is part of my store of knowledge. I write posts to answer peoples questions so that I have a place to point them to. Occasionally people will email me asking a question and if it requires a detailed response I will write a post and email them to tell them that this is the answer. I often point my work colleagues at my blog when they ask me questions about Azure or Powershell. You could also see your blog as an extension of your CV and use it when job hunting and develop it in that way</P>
<P>I also write posts to expand my knowledge and this is the same for speaking. When I am writing a blog post or a presentation I will read and watch videos and ensure I know more about it. The process of creating that content will improve my own knowledge and work practices and you will find that, as you write your blog posts you will have a deeper knowledge also. When you give your presentations you will learn as you answer questions or find the answer to the question afterwards (It’s ok to do that) that you are improving yourself and your knowledge.You will also be giving back.</P>
<P>Putting your information online will enable people to find it. Sure you can worry about SEO and getting to the top of search pages but you know that <A href="https://blog.robsewell.com/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/" target=_blank>sometimes the answer is on the ninth page</A>. What you write will be of benefit to others and by taking the time to post you will be giving back to the community</P>
<P>You can do one, many or all of those and you will be giving back. I hope you do</P>
<P>I will be giving back. You will find me at <A href="https://sqlbits.com" target=_blank>SQL Bits</A> where I shall be room monitoring and volunteering.</P>
<P>You will find me at SQL Saturday Exeter. I am again one of the fabulous SQL South West team</P>
