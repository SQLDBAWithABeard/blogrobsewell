Twas 2 days before Xmas & all through the office,  
not a creature was stirring not even old Maurice.  
With merriment going on outside of his window  
There sat a bearded DBA without much to do

No changes can be made through the holiday season  
We’re on skeleton support, which is a good reason  
Ensure you are making the most of your time  
You mustn’t be wasting the company dime

The backups are checked, there isn’t an issue  
So documentation writing should ensue  
Instead he decided to procrastinate  
And so, this little ditty he proceeded to create

Looking back over last year he did ruminate  
About all the progress he had made, it was great  
So much had been learned, so many improvements  
Derived using content from fine ladies and gents

Impossible to estimate how much it would cost  
Or calculate the amount of revenue lost  
For all that he would have been unable to do  
Or the times that he knew how to get out of a stew

But also the friends old, new and the rest  
The talking and dining and drinking and jest  
I am lucky to be a part of the SQL Family  
So thank you one and all, with love from me
