My wonderful friend [Chrissy LeMaire](https://twitter.com/cl) and I are the creators of two GitHub repositories for SQL Server and PowerShell called [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/) and [dbareports](https://dbareports.io)

If you are working with SQL Server I highly recommend that you take a look at the vast number of commands available to you at [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/) which will help you complete tasks within SQL Server especially for Instance migrations and also a growing number of best practice implementations

Both of these modules are not just the work of one person any more. We have over 20 people who have collaborated on the modules THANK YOU ALL and more that have provided guidance and comments via the Slack Channels in the SQL Server Community Slack [https://sqlps.io/slack](https://sqlps.io/slack) and via the Trello boards [https://dbatools.io/trello](https://dbatools.io/trello) and [https://dbareports/trello](https://dbareports/trello)

At SQL Saturday Cambridge this weekend I was proud to join Chrissy in her presentation as we talked about both modules. Heres a fabulous picture of us with Buck Woody

We had discussed previously that it didn’t feel quite right that these community tools were under our own personal accounts and it also caused some administration issues with allowing access. So with that in mind after a naming discussion in the slack channel we created an organisation to hold them both

 SQL Server Community Collaborative
-----------------------------------

is born at [https://github.com/sqlcollaborative](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative)

Nothing much changes except the name. we have even found that all the old links work and GitHub desktop updated. We will continue to make great commands with all of our fantastic collaborators. Discussions will happen in Slack and organisation in Trello and we will continue to grow and learn and teach and share and create together.

We would love you to come and join us
