[PASS Summit](http://www.pass.org/summit/2018/) is the largest conference for technical professionals who leverage the Microsoft Data Platform. PASS Summit 2018 is happening November 5th – 9th 2018 in Seattle. It is an amazing conference. I attended last year and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It is a whole week of opportunities to learn from and network with people from all over the world involved in Data Platform.

The pre-cons have just been announced so go and take a look at the [Pre-Con Page](http://www.pass.org/summit/2018/Learn/Pre-ConferenceSessions.aspx) to see the wonderful full day learning opportunities you can get this year.

I am immensely honoured to say that on Tuesday 6th November you can [join me for a whole day of PowerShell learning ](http://www.pass.org/summit/2018/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=80306)

I will pass on as much of the skills and knowledge I have learnt using PowerShell with SQL Server (and other technologies) that I can fit in one day. I want you to leave feeling more confident in using PowerShell to automate away all of the mundane. In particular I want to enable you to have the skills to write professional PowerShell solutions.
