Just a quick post to share some code that I used to solve a problem I had recently.

I needed to automate the deployment of some Power Bi reports to a Power Bi Report Server PBRS using TFS. I had some modified [historical validation dbachecks](https://blog.robsewell.com/dbachecks-dark-mode-historical-validation-powerbi/) pbix files that I wanted to automate the deployment of and enable the client to be able to quickly and simply deploy the reports as needed.

The manual way
--------------

It is always a good idea to understand how to do a task manually before automating it. To deploy to PBRS you need to use the Power Bi Desktop optimised for Power Bi Report Server. [There are instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/report-server/quickstart-create-powerbi-report). Then it is easy to deploy to the PBRS by clicking file and save as and choosing Power Bi Report Server

If I then want to set the datasource to use a different set of credentials I navigate to the folder that holds the report in PBRS and click the hamburger menu and Manage

![manage](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/manage.png)

and I can alter the User Name and Password or the type of connection by clicking on DataSources

and change it to use the reporting user for example.

Automation
----------

But I dont want to have to do this each time and there will be multiple pbix files, so I wanted to automate the solution. The end result was a VSTS or TFS release process so that I could simply drop the pbix into a git repository, commit my changes, sync them and have the system deploy them automatically.

As with all good ideas, I started with a google and found [this post](http://byobi.com/2018/04/programmatically-deploy-power-bi-reports-to-power-bi-report-server/) by [Bill Anton](https://twitter.com/SQLbyoBI)Â which gave me a good start ( I could not get the connection string change to work in my test environment but this was not required so I didnt really examine why)

I wrote a function that I can use via TFS or VSTS by embedding it in a PowerShell script. The function requires theÂ [ReportingServicesTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/ReportingServicesTools) module which you can get by

Install-Module -Name ReportingServicesTools

The function below is available via the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PublishPBIXFile/1.0.0.2/DisplayScript) also and you can get it with

Install-Script -Name PublishPBIXFile

The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Functions/blob/master/PublishPBIXFile.ps1)

and the code to call it looks like this

```
$folderName = 'TestFolder'
$ReportServerURI = 'http://localhost/Reports'
$folderLocation = '/'
$pbixfile = 'C:\Temp\test.pbix'
$description = "Descriptions"

$publishPBIXFileSplat = @{
    ReportServerURI    = $ReportServerURI
    folderLocation     = $folderLocation
    description        = $description
    pbixfile           = $pbixfile
    folderName         = $folderName
    AuthenticationType = 'Windows'
    ConnectionUserName = $UserName1
    Secret             = $Password1
    Verbose            = $true
}
Publish-PBIXFile @publishPBIXFileSplat
```

![code1.PNG](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/code1.png)

which uploads the report to a folder which it will create if it does not exist. It will then upload pbix file, overwriting the existing one if it already exists

![numbe3r1.PNG](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/numbe3r1.png)

and uses the username and password specified

![code2.PNG](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/code2.png)

If I wanted to use a Domain reporting user instead I can do
```
$UserName1 = 'TheBeard\ReportingUser'

$publishPBIXFileSplat = @{
    ReportServerURI    = $ReportServerURI
    folderLocation     = $folderLocation
    description        = $description
    pbixfile           = $pbixfile
    folderName         = $folderName
    AuthenticationType = 'Windows'
    ConnectionUserName = $UserName1
    Secret             = $Password1
    Verbose            = $true
}
Publish-PBIXFile @publishPBIXFileSplat
```
and it changes

![code4 reporting](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/code4-reporting.png)

If we want to use a SQL Authenticated user then
```
$UserName1 = 'TheReportingUserOfBeard'

$publishPBIXFileSplat = @{
    ReportServerURI    = $ReportServerURI
    folderLocation     = $folderLocation
    description        = $description
    pbixfile           = $pbixfile
    folderName         = $folderName
    AuthenticationType = 'SQL'
    # credential = $cred
    ConnectionUserName = $UserName1
    Secret             = $Password1

}
Publish-PBIXFile @publishPBIXFileSplat
```
![sql auth.PNG](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/sql-auth.png)

Excellent, it all works form the command line. You can pass in a credential object as well as username and password. The reason I enabled username and password? So that I can use TFS or VSTS and store my password as a secret variable.

Now I simply create a repository which has my pbix files and a PowerShell script and build a quick release process to deploy them whenever there is a change ðŸ™‚

The deploy script looks like
```

    $PBIXFolder,
    $ConnectionStringPassword

Although the function does not need to be embedded in the script and can be deployed in a module, I have included it in here to make it easier for people to use quickly. I

Then create a PowerShell step in VSTS or TFS and call the script with the parameters as shown below and PowerBi files auto deploy to Power Bi Report Server

Happy Automating ðŸ™‚
