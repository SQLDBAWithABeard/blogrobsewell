Saturday 27th April is Global Azure Bootcamp day

Whatâ€™s Global Azure Bootcamp?

The [website](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/) says it best

> â€¦. communities will come together once again in the sixth great Global Azure Bootcamp event! Each user group will organize their own one day deep dive class on Azure the way they see fit and how it works for their members. The result is that thousands of people get to learn about Azure and join together online under the social hashtag [#GlobalAzure](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GlobalAzure)!

Saturday Is Free Learning
-------------------------

I am a part of the team organising the event in Exeter. Now there is a little story here. We had chosen this date by chance to hold an event we call Data In Devon giving people in the South West (of UK) the chance to access a whole day of high quality data and technical sessions for free on a Saturday.

When the Global Azure Bootcamp was announced, we had a conversation with the organisers and they agreed that we could add Exeter as a venue as we had already decided to have a whole track dedicated to Azure. You can find our schedule here [https://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/data-in-devon-saturday-schedule/](https://sqlsouthwest.co.uk/data-in-devon-saturday-schedule/) and you can register to attend [via this form](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-in-devon-registration-50262066193v)Â 

Now, we have some costs obviously, not a lot but venues are not free and neither is food ðŸ˜‰. We have a couple of sponsors (feel free to contact me if your company is interested in sponsoring the event) but we also have some paid training days on Friday 25th April.

Friday Is Training Day
----------------------

Itâ€™s a great opportunity to get cheap high-quality training from some of the best in their areas of expertise. There are still some tickets for Â£175 and the price will rise only to Â£200. I think that Â£200 is fantastic value to be able to spend a day learning from
