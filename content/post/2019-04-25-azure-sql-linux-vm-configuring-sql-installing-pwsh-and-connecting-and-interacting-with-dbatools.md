In my posts about using Azure Devops to build Azure resources with Terraform, [I built a Linux SQL VM.](https://blog.robsewell.com/using-the-same-azure-devops-build-steps-for-terraform-with-different-pipelines-with-task-groups/) I used the [Terraform in this GitHub](https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Presentations-AzureSQLVM) repository and created this

Connecting with MobaXterm
-------------------------

I had set the Network security rules to accept connections only from my static IP using variables in the Build Pipeline. I use [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) as my SSH client. Its a free download. I click on sessions

Choose a SSH session and fill in the remote host address from the portal

Configuring SQL
---------------

The next task is to configure the SQL installation. Following the instructions on the [Microsoft docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sql/provision-sql-server-linux-virtual-machine?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-5002693) I run

    sudo systemctl stop mssql-server
    sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set-sa-password
enter the sa password and

Now to start SQL

    sudo systemctl start mssql-server

Installing pwsh
---------------

Installing PowerShell Core (pwsh) is easy with snap

   sudo snap install powershell --classic

A couple of minutes of downloads and install

and pwsh is ready for use

Installing dbatools
-------------------

To install [dbatools](http://dbatools.io) from the [Powershell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/dbatools) simply run

   Install-Module dbatools -Scope CurrentUser

This will prompt you to allow installing from an untrusted repository

[![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/04/image-126.png)

and dbatools is ready to go

    #Set a credential
    $cred = Get-Credential
    # Show the databases on the local instance
    Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance localhost -SqlCredential $cred

I can also connect with Azure Data Studio

and connect

Just a quick little post explaining what I did ðŸ™‚

Happy Linuxing!
