I have been asked a couple of times recently what my Visual Studio Code extensions are at the moment so I thought I would write a quick post and also look at workspaces and how you can enable and disable extensions within them

Listing Extensions
------------------

From the command line you can list your extensions using

    code --list-extensions
    code-insiders --list-extensions

My list looks like this

You can also see them in the view on the left of default Visual Studio Code and open them with CTRL + SHIFT + X (unless like me you have Snagit installed and it has taken that shortcut

Installing Extensions
---------------------

You can install extensions by opening the Extensions view in Visual Studio Code and searching for the extension. The list I have below has the precise names for each extension which you can use to search

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/image-24.png )

You can also install extensions from the command-line with

    code --install-extension <extensionid>
    code-insiders --install-extension <extensionid>

My Extensions

I am going to list these in alphabetical order by display name for ease (my ease that is!)

Because Chrissy LeMaire and I are writing [dbatools in a Month of Lunches](https://beard.media/book) using AsciiDoc, it makes sense to have an extension enabling previewing and syntax, you can find it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stayfool.vscode-asciidoc)

For working with SQL Server within Visual Studio Code and having a view for my instances as well as a linter and intellisense I use ms-mssql.mssql

Yaml files and spaces! I no longer get so confused with this extension to help me ðŸ™‚ redhat.vscode-yaml

Workspaces
----------

Now that is a lot of extensions and I dont need all of them everytime. I use workspaces to help with this. I will create a workspace file for the project I am working on.

I open or create the folders I will be working on and then click File and Save Workspace As and save the file in the root of the folder.

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/image-25.png )

Now, the next time I want to open the workspace, I can open the workspace file or if I open the folder Visual Studio Code will helpfully prompt me

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/image-26.png )

Now I can have all of my settings retained for that workspace

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/image-27.png )

For this folder, I am ensuring that the PowerShell extension uses the PSScriptAnalyzer Settings file that I have created so that it will show if the code is compatible with the versions of PowerShell I have chosen. I can define settings for a workspace in the settings file, which you can open using CTRL and ,

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/image-28.png )

But I can also enable or disable extensions for a workspace

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2019/11/image-29.png )

So everytime I open this workspace I am only loading the extensions I want
