I am sat in the PowerShell Saturday in Hamburg. You can see me on the right of this picture writing [my previous blog post!](https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/jupyter%20notebooks/azure%20data%20studio/pester/net-powershell-notebooks-using-pester/)

I was talking with my friend Mathias Jessen [@IISResetMe on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IISResetMe) about notebooks and he said that another great use case was to use them on Stack OverFlow  

Now Mathias is an active answerer on Stack OverFlow  

![](https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2020/02/image-16.png)  

and he puts a lot of effort into writing his answers, formatting them, including code and results. Basically exactly the same as a Notebook. However, with a Notebook, you can enable people to **_run_** the code as well on their own machines.  

Mathias says he will use notebooks to help people when he answers their PowerShell questions on Stack OverFlow. If you are a Stack OverFlow Answerer then you can too.
