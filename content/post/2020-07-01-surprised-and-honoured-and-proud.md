I have always been extremely proud to be a Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP, and lucky enough to be involved with both the PowerShell community as well as the Data Platform community.

Today, July 1st is the date that many MVPs receive their renewal email to let them know that they have been awarded for another year. There is a lot of F5’ing and frequent checking of emails and “Have you heard yet?” DMs going around.

When I received the news, I was using Azure DevOps to run PowerShell and Terraform to build an Azure SQL Elastic Pool (yes, I will write a blog post about it!). I love technology and within my work, like many people, I work across many different disciplines. Azure, Azure DevOps, SQL Server and Microsoft Data Platform products are the main focus of my time.  
  
I didn’t notice the significance of the information.

I was pleased as punch to be renewed again, proud that what I do is recognised by Microsoft, honoured to spend another year as an MVP. Then my friends pointed out the big news that I had missed.

There are two award categories.  
  
I have been awarded for both Cloud and Datacenter Management and Data Platform.  
  
I am beyond words.  
  
Proud, Surprised and Honoured.  
  
Thank you to all of the people who help and support me. You help more than you will ever know.

I am going to go and prop my jaw shut!
