Last night I started the experiment that has been in my head for a while now, to move from SQL Dba With A Beard to RobSewell.com

Thank you Chrissy [Blog](https://blog.netnerds.net/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cl) for the push!

I followed the instructions from her blog post [Migrating my WordPress sites to GitHub Pages](https://blog.netnerds.net/2020/08/migrating-my-wordpress-sites-to-github-pages/) but chose to use the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)

I like the search at the top and the [404 page :-)](https://blog.robsewell.com/404.html)

Now I need to export the wordpress from SQLDbaWithABeard.com (Its currently running)

I will still blog on there for a while I think but export it to here also or blog on here and export to there, one or the other
