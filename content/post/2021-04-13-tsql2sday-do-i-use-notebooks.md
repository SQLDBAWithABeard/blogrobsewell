# Do I use Notebooks?

T-SQL Tuesday is the brainchild of Adam Machanic ([Blog](http://dataeducation.com/)  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adammachanic?lang=en)). The first T-SQL Tuesday invitation was in December 2009 and it is still going strong. It is a monthly blog party on the second Tuesday of each month. Currently, Steve Jones ([Blog](https://voiceofthedba.com/)  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/way0utwest)) organises the event and maintains [a website with all previous posts](http://tsqltuesday.com/). Everyone is welcome to participate in this monthly blog post.

This month’s T-SQL Tuesday is hosted by Steve. Steve says: 

>I want you to write about how you have used, or would like to use, a Jupyter notebook. This seemed to be exciting for many people at first, but I haven’t seen a lot of uptake from users in general. So I’m curious if you are using them.

# Am I using Notebooks ?

Hehe. I LOVE notebooks. I use them all of the time and every day.  

- [I have written a few posts about them as well](https://blog.robsewell.com/categories/#jupyter-notebooks). 
- I have a repository on GitHub with many notebooks [https://beard.media/Notebooks](https://beard.media/Notebooks). 
- I have given presentations about notebooks [https://beard.media/presentations](https://beard.media/presentations) 
- I have videos on my youtube channel about notebooks [https://beard.media/notebooksyoutube](https://beard.media/notebooksyoutube)
- I have written a [PowerShell Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ADSNotebook/0.0.20201008.1) to create Notebooks []

I have assisted clients with using notebooks to

- Integrate new team members
- Create a repository of incident response notebooks [dynamically created with Azure DevOps](https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/jupyter%20notebooks/azure%20data%20studio/powershell/dynamically-creating-azure-data-studio-notebooks-with-powershell-for-an-incident-response-index-notebook/)
- Create a repository of daily tasks notebooks
- Create a repository of common large scale changes
- Off-load DBA requests to Service Desk with notebooks
- Use notebooks to demonstrate changes to Product Owners and other teams
- Use notebooks for diagnosis by customers
- Use notebooks to investigate Azure environments and Azure Data Services
- and more

I use notebooks to validate dbachecks PRs, to demonstrate [dbachecks](https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/JupyterNotebooks/tree/master/notebooks/NotDotNet/dbachecks) and [dbatools](https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/JupyterNotebooks/tree/master/notebooks/NotDotNet/dbatools) with docker that anyone can use.

I am thoroughly looking forward to seeing what other people do with notebooks. I love how the community helps us all to develop and move forward by sharing.
