Designed specifically for DBAs working in hybrid environments, this training day will equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to excel in your role. Whether you're managing on-premises databases, Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, or Azure virtual machines, this training has you covered.

As technology evolves, so does the role of a Database Administrator (DBA). In today's hybrid computing landscape, where applications are deployed across on-premises and cloud platforms, DBAs face new challenges and opportunities. To navigate this changing landscape, it's crucial to stay ahead of the curve and expand your skill set.

## Automation

One of the key focuses of the training is automation. As authors of[dbatools in a Month of Lunches](https://beard.media/book)" we will provide hands-on experience using automation tooling, such as PowerShell and community-developed modules like dbatools, dbachecks, and ImportExcel. You'll learn how to automate routine tasks, streamline your operations, and save valuable time and effort. From simple tasks to complex processes, automation will become your best friend in managing your hybrid environment.

Additionally, this training we'll introduce you to the concept of infrastructure as code. You'll discover how to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of your SQL Server instances and PaaS services. The training doesn't stop there. You'll explore the power of GitHub Actions and Azure Functions, unlocking the ability to integrate your workflows with other tools in your environment. These techniques will elevate the quality of your work, reduce manual intervention, and improve overall productivity.

Whether you're a seasoned DBA, a developer working with SQL Server, an accidental DBA, or someone with DevOps responsibilities, this training is tailored to suit your needs. Jess and Rob will guide you through various scenarios, enabling you to sharpen your skills and empower your team to be more efficient.

Rest assured, you don't need any specific equipment or tools to attend this training. All scripts and slides will be provided, and you'll have the opportunity to follow along with most of the demos. Just bring something to take notes with, as you'll be learning a wealth of valuable solutions to bring back to your workplace. If you bring a laptop then having a container runtime like docker or podman will be beneficial.
