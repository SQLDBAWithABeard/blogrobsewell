&gt;dbachecks&lt;/a&gt;Â we enable people to see what checks are available by running Get-DbcCheck. This gives a number of properties including the â€˜typeâ€™ of check. This refers to the configuration item or parameter that is required to have a value for this check to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example â€“ Any check to do with SQL Agent is of type Sqlinstance because it requires an instance to be specified but a check for SPN is of type ComputerName because it requires a computer name to run.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using the AST in Pester for dbachecks</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/using-the-ast-in-pester-for-dbachecks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/using-the-ast-in-pester-for-dbachecks/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/01/02-Pester-results-1.png" alt="Featured image of post Using the AST in Pester for dbachecks" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;TagLine â€“ My goal â€“ Chrissy will appreciate Unit Tests one day ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Chrissy has written about dbachecks&lt;/a&gt; the new up and coming community driven open source PowerShell module for SQL DBAs to validate their SQL Server estate. we have taken some of the ideas that we have presented about a way of using &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;dbatools&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Pester/Pester" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Pester&lt;/a&gt; to validate that everything is how it should be and placed them into a meta data driven framework to make things easy for anyone to use. It is looking really good and I am really excited about it. It will be released very soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
