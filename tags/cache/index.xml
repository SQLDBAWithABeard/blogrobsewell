&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Bicep version 0.4.1008 you can save and version your Bicep modules in repositories. &lt;a class="link" href="https://msftplayground.com/2021/11/using-private-repositories-for-bicep-modules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;You can read more about how to do it here&lt;/a&gt;. This is really useful for reusing modules and modularising large corporate infrastructure environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can control how a single resource (think of a storage account) is deployed across your environment and ensure that all requirements are followed (the storage account must have public access disabled, must have private endpoints and must have the one production network allowed). This is really useful and since it has been available we have used this to deploy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
