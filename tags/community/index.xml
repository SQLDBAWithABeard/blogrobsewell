&lt;p&gt;T-SQL Tuesday, which was started by Adam Machanic (&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/amachanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; is hosted by a different person each month. The host selects the theme, and then the blogging begins. Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month it is hosted by &lt;a class="link" href="https://debthedba.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;SQLBits&lt;/a&gt; is the largest data platform conference in Europe. It has been running every year since 2007 in a different city in the UK providing sessions into all things data platform. I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

This post will describe how the automation was created using a GitHub Issue and two GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-need"&gt;What do we need?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to have a form for user input that could easily allow a person to add themselves and some information to a web page. The page holds a list of speakers who can present training day sessions for data platform events. &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;The web page can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. This page is generated from a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Training Day Speakers List</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/training-day-speakers-list/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/training-day-speakers-list/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/magnify.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Training Day Speakers List" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do data platform events find Training Day/Pre-Con speakers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;So we built a thing for speakers to add themselves and for events to find them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think event organisers know who the &lt;em&gt;big names&lt;/em&gt; are and the topics that they can deliver for full day training sessions or pre-cons as they are also known. Finding other speakers and finding speakers who can deliver on different topics is a little more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/containers2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="broken-link"&gt;Broken Link

&lt;p&gt;So SQLBits has finished for another year. About 1500 people registered for the largest SQL Conference in Europe held over 4 days in Liverpool last week. 2 days of full day sessions and 2 days of shorter sessions, a pub quiz, a party (literally) out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is organised and run by volunteers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we must pay special thanks to Simon, Darren, Chris, Jonathan, Annette, Allan and Alex without forgetting all that JRJ has done. They ensured that the venue, sessions, speakers, sponsors, audio visual and not forgetting the amazing party by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sneaky Experience (Thank you Julia),&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; all occurred at the right time in the right place with the right people and the work and effort they have put in cannot be over-estimated but this post isn’t about those generous, inspiring, amazing folk
Several people asked me what a volunteer does and how they can become one and hopefully this post will answer both of those questions. More than 40 people volunteered to help at SQL Bits&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerShelling SQL Saturday Sessions to the Guidebook app</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershelling-sql-saturday-sessions-to-the-guidebook-app/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershelling-sql-saturday-sessions-to-the-guidebook-app/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from my &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqldbawithabeard.com/2015/03/21/parsing-xml-child-nodes-and-converting-to-datetime-with-PowerShell/" title="Parsing XML Child Nodes and Converting to DateTime with PowerShell"

&gt;previous pos&lt;/a&gt;t about parsing XML where I used the information from &lt;a class="link" href="https://voiceofthedba.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/downloading-sql-saturday-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Steve Jones blog post&lt;/a&gt; to get information from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;SQL Saturday web site&lt;/a&gt; I thought that this information and script may be useful for others performing the same task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit - This post was written prior to the updates to the SQL Saturday website over the weekend. When it can back up the script worked perfectly but the website is unavailable at the moment again so I will check and update as needed once it is back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Giving Back – #TSQL2sday</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/giving-back-tsql2sday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/giving-back-tsql2sday/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TSQL2sDay150x150.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;T-SQL Tuesday, which was started by Adam Machanic (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a class="link" href="http://twitter.com/adammachanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) and is now starting its 6th year, is hosted by a different person each month. The host selects the theme, and then the blogging begins. Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme. This month it is hosted by Wayne Sheffield &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2014/12/t-sql-tuesday-61-giving-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.twitter.com/#/DBAWayne" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and in the spirit of the holiday season it is about giving. This is my post on giving back, in the little ways as well as the bigger ones, how you can give back and why it not only benefits others but also yourself&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
