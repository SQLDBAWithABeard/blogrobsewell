&gt;SQL Saturday Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was getting an error whilst trying to set CLR Enabled during an automatic install and asked if I had any ideas. The error he had was related to Invoke-SQLcmd and the method he was calling the PowerShell script&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to replicate his problem on my servers so I looked at other methods that may assist as well as following up with him to try and understand what was causing his issue. In doing so I worked out the following method to change the CLR Enabled setting by SMO and thought it worth a blog post to share&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
