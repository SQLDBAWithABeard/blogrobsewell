&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2015/02/03/sql-server-script-whenwho-did-auto-grow-for-the-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;as it happened I had a requirement to make use of the script only a few days later. I was asked to provide the information in a CSV so that the person who required the information could manipulate it in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a great believer in Automation. If you are going to do something more than once then automate it so I wrote two functions, added them to TFS and now they will be available to all of my team members next time they load PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
