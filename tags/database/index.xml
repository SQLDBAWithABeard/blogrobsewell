It is easy in a large organisation for database numbers to rapidly increase and sometimes the DBA may not be aware of or be able to control the rise if they don’t have knowledge of all of the database servers on the estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of benefits of rationalisation to the business. Reduced cpu usage = reduced heat released = lower air-con bill for the server room and less storage used = quicker backups and less tapes used or better still less requirement for that expensive new SAN. You may be able to consolidate data and provide one version of the truth for the business as well. Removing servers can release licensing costs which could then be diverted elsewhere or pay for other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
