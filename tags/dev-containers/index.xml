&lt;h1 id="protecting-the-repository"&gt;Protecting the repository
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened the repository in the browser and GitHub and was provided with a warning that said&lt;/p&gt;

alt="protect your branch"
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the protect this branch button gave the reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your most important branches
Branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating A Training Day Speakers List with GitHub Action from a GitHub Issue</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-training-day-speakers-list-with-github-action-from-a-github-issue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-training-day-speakers-list-with-github-action-from-a-github-issue/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/bench.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Creating A Training Day Speakers List with GitHub Action from a GitHub Issue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/community/Training-Day-Speakers-List" &gt;The last post&lt;/a&gt; showed the resource that we created to enable speakers to let events know that they have content for pre-cons/training days. This post will describe how the automation was created using a GitHub Issue and two GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-need"&gt;What do we need?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to have a form for user input that could easily allow a person to add themselves and some information to a web page. The page holds a list of speakers who can present training day sessions for data platform events. &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;The web page can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. This page is generated from a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/github-pages-in-dev-containers-and-codespaces/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/containers2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post GitHub Pages in Dev Containers and Codespaces" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="broken-link"&gt;Broken Link
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It started with a message from Mikey Bronowski ( &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bronowski.it/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;Now this means that you get to see my awesome &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/justsomethingsad" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;404 page &lt;/a&gt; which makes me laugh every time! It is not a very good look though and does not help people who are reading the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-do-something-manual-when-you-can-automate-it"&gt;Why do something manual when you can automate it
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog is running on GitHub Pages via a repository. Every time a change is pushed to the repo a GitHub Action runs which rebuilds the jekyll site and makes it available.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
