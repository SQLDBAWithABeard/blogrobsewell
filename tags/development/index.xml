&lt;p&gt;T-SQL Tuesday, which was started by Adam Machanic (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a class="link" href="http://twitter.com/adammachanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) and is now starting its 6th year, is hosted by a different person each month. The host selects the theme, and then the blogging begins. Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme. This month it is hosted by Wayne Sheffield &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2014/12/t-sql-tuesday-61-giving-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and in the spirit of the holiday season it is about giving. This is my post on giving back, in the little ways as well as the bigger ones, how you can give back and why it not only benefits others but also yourself&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SQL Saturday Exeter&amp;ndash;What&amp;rsquo;s the Point?

&gt;#SQLSatExeter&lt;/a&gt; on twitter and see details at the bottom. This post is about my experience at this years event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Those Pesky ‘s</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/those-pesky-s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/those-pesky-s/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="changing-domain-names-in-a-column"&gt;Changing Domain Names in a Column
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick little post for today. Not particularly SQL related but the points at the end are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a task when moving a service to a new development area to change the domain name within columns in several tables from “DOMAIN1\USER” to “DOMAIN2\USER”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SQL I was able to do this quite easily as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;USE [DATABASENAME]
GO
-- Declare variables
DECLARE @Live nvarchar(10)
DECLARE @Dev nvarchar(10)
-- Set the variable to the Domains
Set @Live = 'Live Domain'
Set @Dev = 'Dev Domain'
--Update tables
UPDATE [TABLENAME]
SET [User] = REPLACE([User], @Live, @Dev)
GO
UPDATE [TABLENAME]
SET [Group] = REPLACE([Group], @Live, @Dev)
GO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to do the same for some Oracle databases too and this is where the fun started!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
