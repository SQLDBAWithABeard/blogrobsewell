To avoid this happening I wrote a Powershell script to provide some alerts by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the script and how I worked my way through the solution. I hope it is of benefit to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script works in the following way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterates through a list of servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs a WMI query to gather disk information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the free space has fallen below a threshold, checks to see if it has emailed before and if not emails a warning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resets if free space has risen above the threshold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logs what it does but manages the space the logs use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will have seen before I use a Servers text file in my scripts. This is a text file with a single server name on each line. You could also use a query against a DBA or MDW database using Invoke-SQLCMD2, which ever is the most suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
