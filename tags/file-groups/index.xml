&lt;p&gt;Which indexes are on which filegroups. I found a blog post showing how to &lt;a class="link" href="http://basitaalishan.com/2013/03/03/list-all-objects-and-indexes-per-filegroup-partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;do it with T-SQL&lt;/a&gt; but as is my wont I decided to see how easy it would be with PowerShell. I also thought that it would make a good post to show how I approach this sort of challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
