&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the year draws to a close, it&amp;rsquo;s a time for reflection and setting new goals. It&amp;rsquo;s also a time to over consume calories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years in our house we (My wife Traci &lt;a class="link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/tracisewell.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;(L)&lt;/a&gt; and I) have been participating in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://content.rapha.cc/us/en/story/festive500" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Festive 500&lt;/a&gt;, a cycling challenge that encourages riders to cover 500 kilometers between Christmas Eve and New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;(L)&lt;/a&gt; and I often say, we exercise so that we can eat more nice food.) It provides a fun and motivating way to stay active during a time of year when it&amp;rsquo;s easy to become sedentary. Finally, it is a challenge that we can do together, that requires some planning and organising and provides a great sense of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
