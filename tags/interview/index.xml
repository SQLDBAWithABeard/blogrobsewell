&lt;p&gt;I hate interviews as an interviewee. I have had many memorable experiences with them. Even writing this blog post has been challenging as I relive some of them. I haven’t shared a lot of the worst ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="when-i-was-a-lad"&gt;When I was a lad
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first interview was for a waiter/washer up at a local country pub aged 15 or so. I stumbled and stammered and stuttered my way through and I think it was only because they needed someone that evening that I got the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
