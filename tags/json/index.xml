As is frequent with these they are as much for me to refer to in the future and also because the very act of writing it down will aid me in remembering. I encourage you to do the same. Share what you learn because it will help you as well as helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was writing some Pester tests for a module that I was writing when I needed some sample data. I have &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/writing-dynamic-and-random-tests-cases-for-pester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;written before about using Json for this purpose&lt;/a&gt; This function required some data from a database so I wrote the query to get the data and used &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;dbatools&lt;/a&gt; to run the query against the database using &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbatools.io/functions/Get-DbaDatabase" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Get-DbaDatabase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taking dbatools Test-DbaLastBackup a little further</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/taking-dbatools-test-dbalastbackup-a-little-further/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/taking-dbatools-test-dbalastbackup-a-little-further/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
