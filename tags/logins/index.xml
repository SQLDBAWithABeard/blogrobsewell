&gt;Glasgow SQL User Group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/SqlGlasgow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;@SQLGlasgow&lt;/a&gt; and presenting sessions with &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/AndreKamman" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Andre Kamman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sql_williamd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;William Durkin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/cl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Chrissy LeMaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented “Green is Good Red is Bad – Turning your checklists into Pester Tests”. I had to make sure I had enough energy beforehand so I treated myself to a fabulous burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it all the time in my daily job as a SQL DBA and at home whilst learning as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do I use PowerShell for automating tasks such as Daily Backup Checks, Drive Space Checks, Service Running Checks, File Space Checks, Failed Agent Job Checks, SQL Error Log Checks, DBCC Checks and more but also for those questions which come up daily and interfere with concentrating on a complex or time consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
