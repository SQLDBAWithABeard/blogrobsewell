&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When PASS announced that operations would cease, a common question was &amp;ldquo;OK, so what happens now? To SQL Saturdays?, to the summit?, to the local user groups?&amp;rdquo; The answers to some of those questions will lie in other conversations but for right now, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Local User Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="user-groups"&gt;User Groups
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;User groups are a fantastic way to expand your knowledge and your network. A place to find like minded people performing similar roles that you can learn from and get support from.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Secret Management module to run SSMS, VS Code and Azure Data Studio as another user</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/using-secret-management-module-to-run-ssms-vs-code-and-azure-data-studio-as-another-user/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/using-secret-management-module-to-run-ssms-vs-code-and-azure-data-studio-as-another-user/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2020/07/runas.png" alt="Featured image of post Using Secret Management module to run SSMS, VS Code and Azure Data Studio as another user" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on from &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/jupyter%20notebooks/azure%20data%20studio/powershell/dbatools/good-bye-import-clixml-use-the-secrets-management-module-for-your-labs-and-demos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;my last post about the Secret Management module&lt;/a&gt;. I was asked another question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use this to run applications as my admin account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user with a beard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good practice to not log into your work station with an account with admin privileges. In many shops, you will need to open applications that can do administration tasks with another set of account credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, people being people, they will often store their admin account credentials in a less than ideal manner (OneNote, Notepad ++ etc) to make it easier for them, so that when they right click and run as a different user, they can copy and paste the password.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Good Bye Import-CliXML – Use the Secrets Management module for your labs and demos</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/good-bye-import-clixml-use-the-secrets-management-module-for-your-labs-and-demos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/good-bye-import-clixml-use-the-secrets-management-module-for-your-labs-and-demos/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="Featured image of post Good Bye Import-CliXML – Use the Secrets Management module for your labs and demos" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t want to read all this?

&lt;p&gt;I have to start here. For the longest time, whenever anyone has asked me how I store my credentials for use in my demos and labs I have always referred them to Jaap Brassers &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Jaap_Brasser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; blog post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="joel-is-also-awesome"&gt;Joel is also awesome!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people wanted a method of storing credentials that didn&amp;rsquo;t involve files on disk I would suggest Joel Bennett’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/jaykul" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;t&lt;/a&gt; module BetterCredentials which uses the Windows Credential Manager&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Surprised and Honoured and Proud</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/surprised-and-honoured-and-proud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/surprised-and-honoured-and-proud/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have always been extremely proud to be a Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP, and lucky enough to be involved with both the PowerShell community as well as the Data Platform community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, July 1st is the date that many MVPs receive their renewal email to let them know that they have been awarded for another year. There is a lot of F5’ing and frequent checking of emails and “Have you heard yet?” DMs going around.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
