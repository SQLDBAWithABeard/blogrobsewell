&lt;p&gt;Today, July 1st is the date that many MVPs receive their renewal email to let them know that they have been awarded for another year. There is a lot of F5’ing and frequent checking of emails and “Have you heard yet?” DMs going around.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Powershell won’t save when running as a scheduled job</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="or-how-sqlbits-put-me-in-touch-with-laerte-and-solved-a-problem"&gt;Or, How SQLBits put me in touch with Laerte and solved a problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a scheduled Powershell job which I use to create an Excel file colour coded for backup checks. (I will blog about it another time) It works brilliantly on my desktop and saves the file to a UNC path and emails the team the location. It works brilliantly when run in Powershell on the server. When I schedule it to run though it doesn’t do so well. The job completes without errors but no file is saved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
