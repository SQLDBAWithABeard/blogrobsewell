&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick little post for today. Not particularly SQL related but the points at the end are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a task when moving a service to a new development area to change the domain name within columns in several tables from “DOMAIN1\USER” to “DOMAIN2\USER”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SQL I was able to do this quite easily as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;USE [DATABASENAME]
GO
-- Declare variables
DECLARE @Live nvarchar(10)
DECLARE @Dev nvarchar(10)
-- Set the variable to the Domains
Set @Live = 'Live Domain'
Set @Dev = 'Dev Domain'
--Update tables
UPDATE [TABLENAME]
SET [User] = REPLACE([User], @Live, @Dev)
GO
UPDATE [TABLENAME]
SET [Group] = REPLACE([Group], @Live, @Dev)
GO
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to do the same for some Oracle databases too and this is where the fun started!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>You Have To Start Somewhere</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2013/02/medium_33194896_thumb.jpg" alt="Featured image of post You Have To Start Somewhere" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;![medium_33194896]({{ &amp;ldquo;/assets/uploads/2013/02/medium_33194896_thumb.jpg&amp;rdquo; | relative_url }})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is looking at the blank page and beginning to type. It’s much easier to go and play with the settings of the site, to look at plugins and other cool things. The only other blog I have written was &lt;a class="link" href="http://wombatsdojogle.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;http://wombatsdojogle.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. This was a little easer as there was always ‘something’ that needed to be written about. Whether it was training or route planning or every day on the road I had material and an obvious thing to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
