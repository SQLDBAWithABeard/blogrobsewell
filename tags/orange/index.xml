&lt;p&gt;I have returned home from SQLBits 2017 The Disco Edition. I am exhausted, my body is pointing out to me in a variety of waysÂ that this is the only week of the year that I spend so much time on my feet. Why would anyone do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="many-months-of-work"&gt;Many months of work
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First though, you need to know that the SQLBits conference is organised and run by volunteers. All of the committee spend many, many long hours, out of their own free time, for many months before and after the event to ensure that the attendees, sponsors, speakers and volunteers experience is trouble free. I think that they do an amazing and fantastic job and repeatedly pull off the best, most enjoyable conference that I have been to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
