&gt;@fatherjack&lt;/a&gt; and Annette &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/Mrsfatherjack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;@Mrsfatherjack&lt;/a&gt; on SSRS and SSIS respectively. During Annettes SSIS session a question was asked about reading email attachments and then loading them into a database. No-one had an answer using SSIS but I said it could be done with Powershell . So I have written the following script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it does is open an Outlook com object, search for an email with a certain subject and save it in the temp folder and then import it into a SQL database. This needs to be done on a machine with Outlook and Excel installed. It is possible to process the email using EWS in an Exchange environment and other people have written scripts to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
