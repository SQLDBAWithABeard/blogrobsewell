&gt;My last post&lt;/a&gt; had a lot of information about the new .NET PowerShell notebooks including installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Notebooks are Jupyter Notebooks that use .NET core to enable C#, F# and PowerShell kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="use-cases"&gt;Use Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main benefits that I see for Jupyter Notebooks for Ops folk is that the results of the query are saved with the notebook. This makes them fantastic for Incident resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an incident at 3am and you know that you will need that information in the wash up meeting the next day instead of copying and pasting results into a OneNote document or a text file, you can simply run the queries in a notebook and save it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>New .NET Notebooks are here – PowerShell 7 notebooks are here.</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/new-net-notebooks-are-here-powershell-7-notebooks-are-here/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/new-net-notebooks-are-here-powershell-7-notebooks-are-here/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2020/02/image-13.png" alt="Featured image of post New .NET Notebooks are here – PowerShell 7 notebooks are here." /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Science folk used Notebooks for documentation and to show re-runnable research.

&gt;dbachecks&lt;/a&gt; we enable people to see what checks are available by running Get-DbcCheck. This gives a number of properties including the ‘type’ of check. This refers to the configuration item or parameter that is required to have a value for this check to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example – Any check to do with SQL Agent is of type Sqlinstance because it requires an instance to be specified but a check for SPN is of type ComputerName because it requires a computer name to run.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A PowerShell Pester Check for parsing SQL scripts</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/a-powershell-pester-check-for-parsing-sql-scripts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/a-powershell-pester-check-for-parsing-sql-scripts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/?s=pester" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;This is a quick Pester test I wrote to ensure that some SQL Scripts in a directory would parse so there was some guarantee that they were valid T-SQL. It uses the SQLParser.dll and because it was using a build server without SQL Server I have to load the required DLLs from the &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;dbachecks&lt;/a&gt;. We even released a new version during the session 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a few steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a project and link to our GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run unit uests with Pester to make sure that our code is doing what we expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update our module version and commit the change to GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign our code with a code signing certificate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish to the PowerShell Gallery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="create-project-and-link-to-github"&gt;Create Project and link to GitHub
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First you need to create a VSTS project by going to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.visualstudio.com/&lt;/a&gt; This is free for up to 5 users with 1 concurrent CI/CD queue limited to a maximum of 60 minutes run time which should be more than enough for your PowerShell module.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing dbachecks – Configurable PowerShell Validation For Your SQL Instances</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/announcing-dbachecks-configurable-powershell-validation-for-your-sql-instances/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/announcing-dbachecks-configurable-powershell-validation-for-your-sql-instances/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/02/09-PowerBi.png" alt="Featured image of post Announcing dbachecks – Configurable PowerShell Validation For Your SQL Instances" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of months members of the &lt;a class="link" href="http://dbatools.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;dbachecks&lt;/a&gt;. This open source PowerShell module will enable you to validate your SQL Instances. Today it is released for you all to start to use 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="validate-your-sql-instances"&gt;Validate Your SQL Instances?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by validate your SQL Instances? You want to know if your SQL Instances are (still) set up in the way that you want them to be or that you have not missed any configurations when setting them up. With dbachecks you can use any or all of the 80 checks to ensure one or many SQL Instances are as you want them to be. Using Pester, dbachecks will validate your SQL Instance(s) against default settings or ones that you configure yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>dbachecks – Configuration Deep Dive</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/dbachecks-configuration-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/dbachecks-configuration-deep-dive/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2018/02/03-autocomplete.png" alt="Featured image of post dbachecks – Configuration Deep Dive" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the day that &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/?p=8997" &gt;we have announced dbachecks&lt;/a&gt;  a PowerShell module enabling you to validate your SQL Instances.

You can do this by using the WhatIf parameter for commands that support it.

&gt;Andre Kamman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/sql_williamd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;Chrissy LeMaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented “Green is Good Red is Bad – Turning your checklists into Pester Tests”. I had to make sure I had enough energy beforehand so I treated myself to a fabulous burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I was talking to some of the attendees and realised that maybe I could show how easy it was to start writing your first Pester test. Here are the steps to follow so that you can write your first Pester test:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Pretty PowerBi Pester Results Template File</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/power-bi/powershell/a-pretty-powerbi-pester-results-template-file/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/power-bi/powershell/a-pretty-powerbi-pester-results-template-file/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>#TSQL2sDay – Get-PostRoundup</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/tsql2sday-get-postroundup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/tsql2sday-get-postroundup/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>Presentation Nerves</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/presentation-nerves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/presentation-nerves/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>Writing Dynamic and Random Tests Cases for Pester</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/writing-dynamic-and-random-tests-cases-for-pester/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/writing-dynamic-and-random-tests-cases-for-pester/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating a PowerShell Module and TDD for Get-SQLDiagRecommendations</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-powershell-module-and-tdd-for-get-sqldiagrecommendations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-powershell-module-and-tdd-for-get-sqldiagrecommendations/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>VSCode – PowerShell extension 1.4.0 new command Out-CurrentFile</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/vscode-powershell-extension-1.4.0-new-command-out-currentfile/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/vscode-powershell-extension-1.4.0-new-command-out-currentfile/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pester for Presentations – Ensuring it goes ok</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/pester-for-presentations-ensuring-it-goes-ok/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/pester-for-presentations-ensuring-it-goes-ok/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was at &lt;a class="link" href="http://psconf.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;PSCONFEU&lt;/a&gt; I presented a session on writing pester tests instead of using checklists.

&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I showed the pester test that I use to make sure that everything is ready for my presentation. A couple of people have asked me about this and wanted to know more so I thought that I would blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have said that I might be being a little OCD about it 😉 I agree that it could seem like that but there is nothing worse than having things go wrong during your presentation. It makes your heart beat faster and removes the emphasis from the presentation that you give.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pester Test Inception and the Show Parameter</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/pester-test-inception-and-the-show-parameter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/pester-test-inception-and-the-show-parameter/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and whilst we were there we were chatting about running Pester Tests. He wanted to know how he could run a Pester Test and not lose the failed tests as they scrolled past him. In his particular example we were talking about running hundreds of tests on thousands of databases on hundreds of servers&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Ola Hallengrens Maintenance solution&lt;/a&gt; If you haven’t go and click the link and look at the easiest way to ensure that all of your essential database maintenance is performed. You can also &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event9/Inside_Ola_Hallengrens_Maintenance_Solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;watch a video from Ola at SQL Bits&lt;/a&gt;
Recently I was thinking about how I could validate that this solution was installed in the way that I wanted it to be so I turned to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/pester/Pester" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Pester&lt;/a&gt; You can find a great &lt;a class="link" href="https://mcpmag.com/articles/2016/05/19/test-powershell-modules-with-pester.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;how to get started here&lt;/a&gt; which will show you how to get Pester and how to get started with TDD.
This isn’t TDD though this is Environment Validation and this is how I went about creating my test.
First I thought about what I would look for in SSMS when I had installed the maintenance solution and made a list of the things that I would check which looked something like this. This would be the checklist you would create (or have already created) for yourself or a junior following this install. This is how easy you can turn that checklist into a Pester Test and remove the human element and open your install for automated testing&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Some Pester Tests for SQL Defaults</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/some-pester-tests-for-sql-defaults/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/some-pester-tests-for-sql-defaults/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was at &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.psconf.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;Irwin Strachans Active Directory Operations Test&lt;/a&gt; which got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to do the same for my usual SQL Set-up. Treating all of your servers to the same defaults makes it even easier to manage at scale remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am comfortable with using SMO to gather and change properties on SQL Instances so I started by doing this&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Pester – The script failed due to call depth overflow.</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-pester-the-script-failed-due-to-call-depth-overflow./</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-pester-the-script-failed-due-to-call-depth-overflow./</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2016/01/pester-success_thumb1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post PowerShell Pester – The script failed due to call depth overflow." /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This error caught me out. I am putting this post here firstly to remind me if I do it again and also to help others who may hit the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have been looking at &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/pester/Pester" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Pester&lt;/a&gt; which is a framework for running unit tests within PowerShell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find some good blog posts about starting with Pester here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I created a function script file &lt;code&gt;Create-HyperVFromBase.ps1&lt;/code&gt; and a tests script file &lt;code&gt;Create-HyperVFromBase.tests.ps1&lt;/code&gt; as shown.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Pester Testing for Parameter Validation</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-pester-testing-for-parameter-validation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-pester-testing-for-parameter-validation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This error caught me out.
