Question questions questions. As a DBA you are the fount of all knowledge. You are the protector of the data after all so obviously you know every little thing that is needed to be known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently, I am asked&lt;/p&gt;

How much RAM is on that server? What type?&lt;br&gt;
What OS? Which Patches were installed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or more SQL based questions about configuration&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
