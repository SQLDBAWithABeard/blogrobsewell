I thoroughly enjoy writing and talking and sharing and commenting and supporting and cherishing all the SQL and PowerShell things. &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqldbawithabeard.com/2016/10/29/powerbi-and-api-visualising-my-checkins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;PSConfAsia&lt;/a&gt; conference. I must say that Matt, Milton, Sebastian and Ben did a fantastic job organising this conference and were proud that there was a notable increase in attendees from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference began (unofficially) with a PowerShell User group session in the Microsoft Offices on Wednesday where &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Ravi Chaganti&lt;/a&gt; spoke about DSC&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;The post on the SQLServer blog at TechNet by the SQL Server Tools Team today&lt;/a&gt; made me jump out of my seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The July update for SSMS includes the first substantial improvement in SQL PowerShell in many years. We owe a lot of thanks for this effort to the great collaboration with our community. We have several new CMDLETs to share with you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one release there are &lt;strong&gt;twenty-five&lt;/strong&gt; new CMDLets for the new sqlserver module&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
