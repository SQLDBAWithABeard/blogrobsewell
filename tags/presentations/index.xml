&gt;PSCONFEU&lt;/a&gt; I presented a session on writing pester tests instead of using checklists.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I showed the pester test that I use to make sure that everything is ready for my presentation. A couple of people have asked me about this and wanted to know more so I thought that I would blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have said that I might be being a little OCD about it ðŸ˜‰ I agree that it could seem like that but there is nothing worse than having things go wrong during your presentation. It makes your heart beat faster and removes the emphasis from the presentation that you give.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
