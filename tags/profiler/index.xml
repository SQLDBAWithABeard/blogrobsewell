There are still a few places available for SQL Relay week 2. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlrelay.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Take a look here for more details&lt;/a&gt; and follow the twitter &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sqlrelay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;hashtag #SQLRelay&lt;/a&gt; for up to date information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link for my slides and demos from the second part are here &lt;a class="link" href="https://t.co/Fik2odyUMA" title="https://t.co/Fik2odyUMA"

&gt;@KevChant&lt;/a&gt; asked where it was getting the information from and I answered that PowerShell was running SQL commands under the hood against the server and if you ran profiler that is what you would see. We didn’t have time to do that in Cardiff but I thought I would do it today to show what happens&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
