&lt;h1 id="in-the-beginning"&gt;In the beginning
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was around May of 2013 that I had written a blog post about spinning up and shutting down an Azure lab with PowerShell after being inspired at my first &lt;a class="link" href="https://sqlbits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;SQLBits Conference&lt;/a&gt; (On a side note, I have attended, volunteered or spoken at every one since and this year I was delighted to become a Committee Member - If you have comments/questions/advice please feel free to email me at rob at sqlbits.com). That blog post still exists &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/azure/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened the repository in the browser and GitHub and was provided with a warning that said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the protect this branch button gave the reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your most important branches
Branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating A Training Day Speakers List with GitHub Action from a GitHub Issue</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-training-day-speakers-list-with-github-action-from-a-github-issue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-training-day-speakers-list-with-github-action-from-a-github-issue/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/bench.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Creating A Training Day Speakers List with GitHub Action from a GitHub Issue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/community/Training-Day-Speakers-List" &gt;The last post&lt;/a&gt; showed the resource that we created to enable speakers to let events know that they have content for pre-cons/training days. This post will describe how the automation was created using a GitHub Issue and two GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-need"&gt;What do we need?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to have a form for user input that could easily allow a person to add themselves and some information to a web page. The page holds a list of speakers who can present training day sessions for data platform events. &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;The web page can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. This page is generated from a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Training Day Speakers List</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/training-day-speakers-list/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/training-day-speakers-list/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/magnify.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Training Day Speakers List" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do data platform events find Training Day/Pre-Con speakers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;So we built a thing for speakers to add themselves and for events to find them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think event organisers know who the &lt;em&gt;big names&lt;/em&gt; are and the topics that they can deliver for full day training sessions or pre-cons as they are also known. Finding other speakers and finding speakers who can deliver on different topics is a little more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Presentation Nerves</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/presentation-nerves/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/presentation-nerves/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking?

I really enjoy giving presentations and when I saw Start-Demo being used at the PowerShell Conference in Hanover I started to make use of it in my presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Start-Demo&lt;/code&gt; was written in 2007 by a fella who knows PowerShell pretty well 🙂  &lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2007/03/03/start-demo-help-doing-demos-using-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2007/03/03/start-demo-help-doing-demos-using-powershell/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then updated in 2012 by Max Trinidad &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.maxtblog.com/2012/02/powershell-start-demo-now-allows-multi-lines-onliners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;http://www.maxtblog.com/2012/02/powershell-start-demo-now-allows-multi-lines-onliners/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enabled support for multi-line code using backticks at the end of each line. This works well but I dislike having to use the backticks in foreach loops, it confuses people who think that they need to be included and to my mind looks a bit messy&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speaking at PowerShell Virtual Chapter and SQL Cardiff User Group this month</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/speaking-at-powershell-virtual-chapter-and-sql-cardiff-user-group-this-month/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/speaking-at-powershell-virtual-chapter-and-sql-cardiff-user-group-this-month/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to say that I will be speaking at the PowerShell Virtual Chapter meeting this Thursday at 4pm GMT 12pm EDT and also at the Cardiff SQL User Group on Tuesday 31st March&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be giving my Making PowerShell Useful for your Team presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have heard about PowerShell and may be spent a little bit of time exploring some of the ways in which it will benefit you at work. You want to be able to perform tasks more specific to your organisation and need to share them with your team. I will show you how you can achieve this by demonstrating&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
