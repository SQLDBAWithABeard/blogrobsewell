&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREE COFFEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;SQL Saturday Exeter on the 22nd March 2014&lt;/a&gt;  we are putting free coffee amongst the sponsors. Yes, it’s a ruse in some ways to put you in the same room as the sponsors whilst your mind is buzzing with all the new SQL learning you have been doing and you are feeling confident and inspired about SQL and what you can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
