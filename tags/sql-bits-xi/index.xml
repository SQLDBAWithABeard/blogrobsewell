&gt;#SQLSatExeter&lt;/a&gt; on twitter and see details at the bottom. This post is about my experience at this years event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
