&gt;using Power Bi with my DBA Database&lt;/a&gt; I have been asked if I would share the PowerShell scripts which I use to populate my database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show how to create the following report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you will find so many items of data that I expect that you will want to create different reports for your own requirements. You will also want to put the report onto PowerBi.com and explore the natural language querying as I show at the end of this post&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>You Have To Start Somewhere</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/you-have-to-start-somewhere/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2013/02/medium_33194896_thumb.jpg" alt="Featured image of post You Have To Start Somewhere" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;![medium_33194896]({{ &amp;ldquo;/assets/uploads/2013/02/medium_33194896_thumb.jpg&amp;rdquo; | relative_url }})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is looking at the blank page and beginning to type. It’s much easier to go and play with the settings of the site, to look at plugins and other cool things. The only other blog I have written was &lt;a class="link" href="http://wombatsdojogle.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;http://wombatsdojogle.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. This was a little easer as there was always ‘something’ that needed to be written about. Whether it was training or route planning or every day on the road I had material and an obvious thing to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
