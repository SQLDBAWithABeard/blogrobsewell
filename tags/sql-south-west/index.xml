&gt;using Power Bi with my DBA Database&lt;/a&gt; I have been asked if I would share the PowerShell scripts which I use to populate my database. They are the secondary part to my DBADatabase which I also use to automate the installation and upgrade of all of my DBA scripts as I started to blog about in this post &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/powershell/sql%20server/installing-and-upgrading-default-scripts-automation-part-one-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Installing and upgrading default scripts automation - part one - Introduction&lt;/a&gt; which is a series I will continue later.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SQL Saturday Exeter&amp;ndash;What&amp;rsquo;s the Point?

&gt;#SQLSatExeter&lt;/a&gt; on twitter and see details at the bottom. This post is about my experience at this years event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March this year the SQL South West User Group hosted SQL Saturday #194 in Exeter. I was a new member to the User Group having finally been able to join them for the first time in January. At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
