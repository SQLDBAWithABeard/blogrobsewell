&gt;SQLBits&lt;/a&gt; is the largest data platform conference in Europe. It has been running every year since 2007 in a different city in the UK providing sessions into all things data platform. I have frequently &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/tags/#sqlbits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;written about SQLBits&lt;/a&gt;, it is close to my heart and has had a significant impact on my life, my career and my circle of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;) and the subject is &lt;em&gt;Giving Back&lt;/em&gt;. He’s given us two options here (as well as the side option of &lt;em&gt;your favorite 2017 improvement&lt;/em&gt;). Pick a way that you’d like to give back to the community and talk about it, or if you already give back,  tell us how and why you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of excellent posts on this subject and one of the things that I like is that you can go to &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;http://tsqltuesday.com&lt;/a&gt; and look up all of the entries which means that for a particular topic you can find a bunch of blog posts from different angles (I miss-typed that as angels first and yes they are all angels!) whether it is &lt;a class="link" href="http://tsqltuesday.com/tag/career-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;I have returned home from SQLBits 2017 The Disco Edition. I am exhausted, my body is pointing out to me in a variety of ways that this is the only week of the year that I spend so much time on my feet. Why would anyone do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="many-months-of-work"&gt;Many months of work
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First though, you need to know that the SQLBits conference is organised and run by volunteers. All of the committee spend many, many long hours, out of their own free time, for many months before and after the event to ensure that the attendees, sponsors, speakers and volunteers experience is trouble free. I think that they do an amazing and fantastic job and repeatedly pull off the best, most enjoyable conference that I have been to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>2016 - That was a Year :-)</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/2016-that-was-a-year-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/2016-that-was-a-year-/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Its the time of year for reflection and I have had the most amazing 2016, I am blessed that I love what I do so much.

&lt;p&gt;So SQLBits has finished for another year. About 1500 people registered for the largest SQL Conference in Europe held over 4 days in Liverpool last week. 2 days of full day sessions and 2 days of shorter sessions, a pub quiz, a party (literally) out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is organised and run by volunteers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we must pay special thanks to Simon, Darren, Chris, Jonathan, Annette, Allan and Alex without forgetting all that JRJ has done. They ensured that the venue, sessions, speakers, sponsors, audio visual and not forgetting the amazing party by &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sneaky Experience (Thank you Julia),&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; all occurred at the right time in the right place with the right people and the work and effort they have put in cannot be over-estimated but this post isn’t about those generous, inspiring, amazing folk
Several people asked me what a volunteer does and how they can become one and hopefully this post will answer both of those questions. More than 40 people volunteered to help at SQL Bits&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Ola Hallengrens Maintenance Solution Default Jobs with PowerShell</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/scheduling-ola-hallengrens-maintenance-solution-default-jobs-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/scheduling-ola-hallengrens-maintenance-solution-default-jobs-with-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a SQL Server DBA you should know about Ola Hallengren and will probably have investigated his Maintenance Solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to just run his script to install the solution and schedule the jobs and know that you have made a good start in keeping your databases safe.

At that meeting Chris Testa O’Neill presented a session and was very passionate about the SQL Community and the benefit of the SQL Saturdays and other events.  I am always keen to learn new things and find ways of developing my skills. As I haven’t won the lottery I also look out for good deals as well!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spinning up and shutting down Windows Azure Lab with Powershell</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/spinning-up-and-shutting-down-windows-azure-lab-with-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So at SQL Bits I went to &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlbits.com/Speakers/Chris_Testa-O_Neill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Chris Testa-O’Neill’s&lt;/a&gt; session on certification. This has inspired me to start working on passing the MCSE exams. My PC at home doesn’t have much grunt and my tablet wont run SQL. I considered some new hardware but I knew I would have a hard time getting authorisation from the Home Financial Director (Mrs F2B) despite my all the amazing justification and benefits I could provide!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Powershell won’t save when running as a scheduled job</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/powershell-wont-save-when-running-as-a-scheduled-job/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="or-how-sqlbits-put-me-in-touch-with-laerte-and-solved-a-problem"&gt;Or, How SQLBits put me in touch with Laerte and solved a problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a scheduled Powershell job which I use to create an Excel file colour coded for backup checks. (I will blog about it another time) It works brilliantly on my desktop and saves the file to a UNC path and emails the team the location. It works brilliantly when run in Powershell on the server. When I schedule it to run though it doesn’t do so well. The job completes without errors but no file is saved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
