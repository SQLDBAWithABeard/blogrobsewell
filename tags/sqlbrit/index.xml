&lt;p&gt;The hardest part is looking at the blank page and beginning to type. It’s much easier to go and play with the settings of the site, to look at plugins and other cool things. The only other blog I have written was &lt;a class="link" href="http://wombatsdojogle.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;http://wombatsdojogle.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. This was a little easer as there was always ‘something’ that needed to be written about. Whether it was training or route planning or every day on the road I had material and an obvious thing to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
