&lt;h1 id="protecting-the-repository"&gt;Protecting the repository
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened the repository in the browser and GitHub and was provided with a warning that said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="assets/uploads/2022/07/protectbranch.png" &gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/07/protectbranch.png"

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the protect this branch button gave the reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your most important branches
Branch protection rules define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating A Training Day Speakers List with GitHub Action from a GitHub Issue</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-training-day-speakers-list-with-github-action-from-a-github-issue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/creating-a-training-day-speakers-list-with-github-action-from-a-github-issue/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/bench.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Creating A Training Day Speakers List with GitHub Action from a GitHub Issue" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/community/Training-Day-Speakers-List" &gt;The last post&lt;/a&gt; showed the resource that we created to enable speakers to let events know that they have content for pre-cons/training days. This post will describe how the automation was created using a GitHub Issue and two GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-need"&gt;What do we need?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to have a form for user input that could easily allow a person to add themselves and some information to a web page. The page holds a list of speakers who can present training day sessions for data platform events. &lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;The web page can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. This page is generated from a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Training Day Speakers List</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/training-day-speakers-list/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/training-day-speakers-list/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.robsewell.com/assets/uploads/2022/magnify.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Training Day Speakers List" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do data platform events find Training Day/Pre-Con speakers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://callfordataspeakers.com/precon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;So we built a thing for speakers to add themselves and for events to find them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think event organisers know who the &lt;em&gt;big names&lt;/em&gt; are and the topics that they can deliver for full day training sessions or pre-cons as they are also known. Finding other speakers and finding speakers who can deliver on different topics is a little more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
