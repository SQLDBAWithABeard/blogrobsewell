I thoroughly enjoy writing and talking and sharing and commenting and supporting and cherishing all the SQL and PowerShell things. &lt;a class="link" href="http://sqldbawithabeard.com/2016/10/29/powerbi-and-api-visualising-my-checkins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;TSQL Tuesdays over 5 years ago&lt;/a&gt; and you will find many brilliant posts under that heading if &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/#q=tsql2sday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;you search for them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing SQL servers at enterprise scale is not a straightforward task. Your aim as a DBA should be to simplify it as much as possible and to automate everything that you possibly can. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johnsansom.com/the-best-database-administrators-automate-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;This post by John Sansom&lt;/a&gt; could have been written for this months party and I recommend that you read it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Populating My DBA Database for Power Bi with PowerShell - Server Info</title><link>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/populating-my-dba-database-for-power-bi-with-powershell-server-info/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.robsewell.com/blog/populating-my-dba-database-for-power-bi-with-powershell-server-info/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Following my last post about &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/sql%20server/using-power-bi-with-my-dba-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;using Power Bi with my DBA Database&lt;/a&gt; I have been asked if I would share the PowerShell scripts which I use to populate my database. They are the secondary part to my DBADatabase which I also use to automate the installation and upgrade of all of my DBA scripts as I started to blog about in this post &lt;a class="link" href="https://blog.robsewell.com/powershell/sql%20server/installing-and-upgrading-default-scripts-automation-part-one-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
