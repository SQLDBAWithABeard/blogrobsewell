&lt;p&gt;T-SQL Tuesday, which was started by Adam Machanic (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a class="link" href="http://twitter.com/adammachanic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) and is now starting its 6th year, is hosted by a different person each month. The host selects the theme, and then the blogging begins. Worldwide, on the second Tuesday of the month (all day, based on GMT time), bloggers attend this party by blogging about the theme. This month it is hosted by Wayne Sheffield &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.waynesheffield.com/wayne/archive/2014/12/t-sql-tuesday-61-giving-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and in the spirit of the holiday season it is about giving. This is my post on giving back, in the little ways as well as the bigger ones, how you can give back and why it not only benefits others but also yourself&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
