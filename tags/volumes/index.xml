Known as &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/dbafromthecold" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;dbafromthecold on twitter&lt;/a&gt; he blogs at &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbafromthecold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;I was reading his latest blog post &lt;a class="link" href="https://dbafromthecold.com/2019/03/21/using-docker-named-volumes-to-persist-databases-in-sql-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Using docker named volumes to persist databases in SQL Server&lt;/a&gt; and decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His instructions worked perfectly and I thought I would try them using a docker-compose file as I like the ease of spinning up containers with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
