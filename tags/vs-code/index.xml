&gt;my last post about the Secret Management module&lt;/a&gt;. I was asked another question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use this to run applications as my admin account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user with a beard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good practice to not log into your work station with an account with admin privileges. In many shops, you will need to open applications that can do administration tasks with another set of account credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, people being people, they will often store their admin account credentials in a less than ideal manner (OneNote, Notepad ++ etc) to make it easier for them, so that when they right click and run as a different user, they can copy and paste the password.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
